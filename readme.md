## Project Description
The goal of this project is to create a functional and professional portfolio website. The website will function as a space to showcase my work, highlight my skills, and provide an avenue of communication between interested parties and myself. 
## Portfolio I want to Emulate
Search and compare at least 3 profile web sites.  Record your findings in the table below and include some aspect of the site that you would like to incorporate into your own site.
